## Authenticate in two easy steps
### 1) Sign in [here](https://tensorpool.dev/login) to get your unique API key.
### 2) When a [context manager](https://tensorpool.mintlify.app/functions/#use-our-context-manager) is initialized, you will be prompted to insert your API key in terminal. Copy and paste it and you're good to go!


###
###
## What if I want to update my API key?
### When wrapping a model with TensorPool, simply insert your API key. You only have to do this one time.
Before:
```python
with TensorPool():
```
After:
```python
# Insert API key as string
example_key = '2fde-34fh-24dw'
with TensorPool(example_key):
```
