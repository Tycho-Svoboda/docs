## What is TensorPool?
TensorPool gives ML developers access to compute in 2 lines of code. Today, developers can train tiny AI models on their laptops or massive ones using large compute clusters – but there's no good solution for the in between. Half of developer time is wasted configuring and wrangling infrastructure, with wrong decisions leading to 10x higher costs & 10x variance in performance. Existing platforms require complex setup and charge by the hour – meaning you pay even when GPUs sit idle. TensorPool eliminates this complexity, while offering simple model-size based pricing.

## When to use TensorPool
You should use TensorPool on small to medium sized models, maxing out at a few hundred gigabytes.

## Differences from normal torch code 
TensorPool aims to be as similar to a local developer experience as possible. So similar that you only have to add two lines, as shown below.
```python
with TensorPool():
   {model code goes here}
   model.realize()
```

/>
